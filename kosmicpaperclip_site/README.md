# Kosmic Paperclip UG – Static Site

Bilingual (DE/EN) static site. No build tools. Ready for GitHub Pages.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create **public** repo named `kosmicpaperclip.github.io` under the `kosmicpaperclip` account.
2. Upload all files/folders from this ZIP to the repo root.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, select **Deploy from branch: main / root** and Save.
4. Open https://kosmicpaperclip.github.io

## Customize
- Replace placeholders in `impressum.html` and `datenschutz.html` (address, HRB, VAT, email, phone).
- Swap logos in `/assets/img/` with your final SVG/PNGs (`logo-blue.png`, `logo-gold.png`).
- Update the mailto link in `kontakt.html`.

## Notes
- No tracking by default. Consent manager only stores settings in localStorage.
- Language toggle persists in localStorage. Default language: German.
- Fonts use system defaults for performance and privacy (can be replaced with locally hosted fonts).
